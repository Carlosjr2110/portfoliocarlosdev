    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I am a full stack developer with experience in building web applications using modern technologies. On the front-end, I typically work with TypeScript and React.js. I have solid knowledge of the Next.js framework, which allows me to efficiently manage both front-end and back-end. For applications that require more complex back-end functionality, I use Node.js. Additionally, I have experience with relational databases, including PostgreSQL and MySQL. I have strong expertise in consuming RESTful and GraphQL APIs, integrating data from various sources to build robust and scalable web applications."
